# DigitSoil Modeller interview
## Task 2. Demonstration of use of a model 

2.1.    Write an example code based on the model description and example parameters listed in the supplementary information of Allison et al. 2010. It is enough to represent only parts of the model, we want to see your way of handling data input, computation, and output display.

2.2.   Provide a visualization (publication quality) on how the SOC of a field nearby your place (or any picked location) varies with parameters of your choice (use dummy/sourced data).  

2.3.    Find the meteorological data of that field you chose in subtask 2.2. using the model of Allison et al. 2010, make predictions on how the SOC varied over a period of 1 week or 1 year under the assumptions of your choice.
